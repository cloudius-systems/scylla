    We enable Raft on every server and the upgrade procedure starts.  All servers join group 0. Then one
    of them fails, the rest enter 'synchronize' state.  We assume the failed server cannot be recovered.
    We cannot just remove it at this point; it's already part of group 0, `remove_from_group0` will wait
    until upgrade procedure finishes - but the procedure is stuck.  To proceed we enter RECOVERY state on
    the other servers, remove the failed one, and clear existing Raft data. After leaving RECOVERY the
    remaining nodes will restart the procedure, establish a new group 0 and finish upgrade.

    kbr-: the test takes about 26 seconds in dev mode on my laptop.
