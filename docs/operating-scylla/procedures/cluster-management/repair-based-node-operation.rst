====================================
Repair-Based Node Operations (RBNO)
====================================

In ScyllaDB, data is transferred between nodes during:

* Topology changes via node operations, such as adding or removing nodes.
* Repair - a row-level background process to compare and sync data between nodes.

By default, the row-level repair mechanism used for the repair process is also 
used during node operations (instead of streaming). We refer to it as 
Repair-Based Node Operations (RBNO).

RBNO provides a more robust, reliable, and safer data streaming for node operations like node-replace and node-add/remove. 
In particular, a failed node operation can resume from the point it stopped - without sending data that has already been synced. 
In addition, with RBNO enabled, you donâ€™t need to repair before or after node operations, such as replace or removenode.

RBNO is enabled for the following node operations:

* bootstrap
* decommission
* rebuild
* removenode
* replace

The following configuration options can be used to enable or disable RBNO:

* ``enable_repair_based_node_ops= true|false`` - Enables or disables RBNO.
* ``allowed_repair_based_node_ops= "replace,removenode,rebuild,bootstrap,decommission"`` - 
  Specifies the node operations for which the RBNO mechanism is enabled.

See :doc:`Configuration Parameters </reference/configuration-parameters/>` for details.
